# U.T.2 -- Prototype 1 -- Submission 1

**World of Warcraft Classes Website**

## 📄 Description

This project is the first submission for module U.T.2, a prototype
created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.\
The goal is to build a webpage that displays information about World of
Warcraft classes, with structure, styling, and basic interactivity.

The prototype includes:\
- A responsive main page\
- Sections showcasing various classes from the game\
- Navigation between sections\
- Visual design using CSS\
- Basic JavaScript features (e.g., show/hide elements, simple effects)

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

The visual style and UI layout of this project were partially inspired
by a modern and clean dashboard concept from Dribbble titled **"Customer
Journey CRM Dashboard"**, which influenced the use of spacing, color
contrast, card layouts, and minimalistic component styling.
